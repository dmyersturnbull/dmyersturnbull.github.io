Restart your computer, enter the BIOS, and open the overclocking settings.
In general, you’ll want to overclock the memory to the XMP profile. For our typical motherboards
and RAM, this meant a change from 2400 MHz to 3600 MHz. This was crucial for running some custom
hardware. Overclock the CPU frequency and cache frequency a little bit at a time. After each
marginal change, run the Intel tuning utility: Run multiple &ldquo;benchmarks&rdquo; and watch the
temperature closely.</li><li>Install the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exelocal">CUDA toolkit</a>.</li></ul><h3 id=developer-mode-and-configuration>Developer mode and configuration</h3><p>First, update Windows to the newest feature release.
Then purge Windows’s horrifically unnecessary built‐in apps.
In an unmistakably irresponsible choice, Windows comes with Candy Crush.
Really, err on the side of assuming they’re useless and shouldn’t be there.
<a href=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire>Kill it with fire</a>
(<a href=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/why-kill-it-with-fire-is-a-terrible-terrible-idea/>1</a>).</p><p>Then install the Windows Developer Mode.
Go to the start menu and type <em>features</em>. Navigate to
<code>Apps and Features → Manage optional features → add feature → Windows Developer Mode → install</code>.
Also disable unnecessary features – from what I found, almost all can be uninstalled.
Finally, install
<a href=https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview>Ubuntu on a Linux subsystem</a>.</p><h3 id=power--update-settings>Power & update settings</h3><p>In the power settings, disable hibernation, automatic sleep mode,
and USB connection suspending. While these can save power, chances are too high that they will
interfere with a long‐running job or backup.</p><p>In some cases, you will want to disable scanning in a drive. This can drop performance.
It can even cause issues because it can open file handles, temporarily preventing writes;
this case it to interfered with data collection on our custom hardware.</p><p><em>Stop automatic updates by installing
<a href=https://www.novirusthanks.org/products/win-update-stop>Win Update Stop</a></em>.
Although I understand Microsoft’s rationale, it’s incredibly annoying that Windows forces
a restart with short notice. This is an enormous problem on a workstation that could be running
an important job while you’re away and don’t respond in time to postpone the update.
Plus, eventually you can’t postpone further. To update Windows, first open Win Update Stop and
enable updates. Disable them again when you’re done.</p><h3 id=chocolatey-and-useful-apps>Chocolatey and useful apps</h3><p>Install <a href=https://chocolatey.org/>Chocolatey</a>, a fantastic package manager.
Run <code>choco upgrade all</code>.
Install with <code>choco install</code>: <code>powershell-core</code>,
<code>terminus</code>, <code>git.install</code>, <code>poshgit</code>, <code>libressl</code>, <code>openssh</code>, <code>gnupg</code>, <code>notepadplusplus.install</code>,
<code>ffmpeg</code>, <code>7zip.install</code>, <code>treesizefree</code>, <code>docker-cli</code>, <code>vagrant</code>, <code>rsync</code>, <code>nodejs.install</code>,
and <code>miniconda3</code>.
A few are not necessary, but the first 8 are important.
You can install user applications via Chocolatey, such as VLC, Slack, Chrome, and Firefox.
Update them all with <code>choco upgrade all</code>.</p><p>Use Terminus as your primary terminal. It’s fantastic. Set powershell-core as your default shell.
Check the PowerShell version using: <code>Get-Host | Select-Object Version</code>. Make sure it’s 7+.
Although I’m used to shell scripting Linux, Powershell is actually quite good.
Instead of needing to parse text from stdout when piping between commands, the data structures
passed around in PowerShell are <em>tables</em>. It’s a much better approach, and I recommend
<a href=https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/getting-started-with-powershell-core-on-windows-mac-and-linux/>learning it</a>.
You can install it in Linux and macOS.
Last, install <a href=https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html>JDK 15</a>
via that link. Do <em>not</em> use OpenJDK.</p><h3 id=security-ssh-and-gpg>Security, SSH, and GPG</h3><p>Take a look at the end of the <a href=https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/#-macos-setup>guide for macOS</a>,
which shows how to set up SSH and GPG keys, certificates, and aliases,
which should work for the Linux subsystem. The SSH key and config instructions should also work in
PowerShell because OpenSSH is installed. The GPG key instructions may need tweaking.
Definitely enable BitLocker or an equivalent.</p></article></html>
