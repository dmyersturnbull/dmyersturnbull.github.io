**Designate data as either living or frozen.**

This is a *stub*.

Frozen data should be timestamped and never changed.
Living data can be updated but may be versioned.
There are some great resources on good data organization, such as the
[OSF’s guide](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738994-Organizing-files).
Here, I’ll document the aspects of my protocols that work well (and leave out those that don’t).
