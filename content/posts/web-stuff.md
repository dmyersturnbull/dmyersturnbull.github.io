This is a *stub*.

I had a few jobs doing web development circa 12–15 years ago.
HTML 4, CSS 2, pre‐ECMAScript 4 Javascript, and either PHP, Python, or ASP.
These languages – especially Javascript, PHP, and ASP – were terrible.
On the side, I tried out Java EE tools like [Spring](https://spring.io) and gave
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) a try.
[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) was the standard practice,
and [Ajax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) was used where needed.

It was all terrible, but straightforward.

Now it’s a mess in a different way.
Terms like “full‐stack developer” abound. MVC is an uncommon choice.
HTML, CSS, and Javascript go in the same files. We’re building backends with Javascript.
A typical stack is huge and chooses technologies in a
[massive set of technologies](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4RIwaNsa--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/am1x3w193daubmywq13d.jpg),.

It’s such a massive chunk of modern software that it’s worth delving into, even if you never plan
to do web development. This documents my journey to understanding some of it, as someone who hasn’t
done web development for 12 years.
