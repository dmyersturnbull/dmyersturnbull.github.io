HTML 4, CSS 2, pre‐ECMAScript 4 Javascript, and either PHP, Python, or ASP.
These languages – especially Javascript, PHP, and ASP – were terrible.
On the side, I tried out Java EE tools like <a href=https://spring.io>Spring</a> and gave

to do web development. This documents my journey to understanding some of it, as someone who hasn’t
done web development for 12 years.</p><h3 id=single-page-applications>Single-page applications</h3><h3 id=language-standards>Language standards</h3><h3 id=build-and-packaging-tools>Build and packaging tools</h3><h3 id=web-frameworks>Web frameworks</h3><h3 id=security--authentication>Security & authentication</h3><h3 id=search>Search</h3><h3 id=cicd>CI/CD</h3><h3 id=cloud-pipelines--containers>Cloud, pipelines, & containers</h3></article></html>
