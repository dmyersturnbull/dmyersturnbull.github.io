This lists some tips, and details how to do certain common-but-difficult things in Bash correctly.

## General

### Use printf, not echo

[POSIX recommends against `echo`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)
because it has serious limitations, including platform-specific behavior, inconsistent `\n` handling,
and an n-ary argument list
[not terminated by `--`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/).

### How to get a script’s own directory

Doing this correctly is a bit tricky.

Note these features:

- `--` is needed because, outside a script, `$0` is (e.g.) `-z`,
  which `readlink` assumes is an option and errors with an unhelpful message.
- The `|| exit $?` after the `readlink` is needed to exit the subshell immediately.
  Otherwise, `dirname` is called but with no stdin, causing it to return `.`.
- The outer `|| exit $?` catches any unlikely nonzero exits from `dirname`.

A tiny caveat: This will fail on a fraction of outrageously strange paths.
In particular, it will break on a path that contains a newline --
a character that ext4 and btrfs support and that Linux will technically accept.
But this would cause more serious problems, and if you’re naming files like this, stop.

```bash
this_dir=$(dirname "$(readlink -f -- "$0" || exit $?)") || exit $?
```
