!!! note "To anyone actually named Kerri Johnson"

    I’ve been consistently using your name as an example for about 10 years, in constant fear this day might come.
    I’ll stop using your name on request.
    <b>History:</b>
    Kerri Johnson was the merger of two previous names, Kerri Kerrigan and John Johnson.
