# Maintainers' guide

This guide contains a collection of best-practices.
They tend to be easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to automate.
They work with a range of CI/CD workflows and various automation tools.
More notably, they are sufficient to get a transparent 1-1-1-1-1 mapping between
issues, feature branches, pull requests, main branch commits, and changelog entries.

## Flow

### Branches

Use [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/)
/ [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).
Name feature branches `<type>/<issue>-<description>`, such as `feat/14-add-schema`.
Each must be tied to exactly 1 issue and result in 1 merge to _main_.

If used, stable release branches must be named `releases/<vr>`; e.g., `releases/v1`.

### Issues

Issues to be worked on must have exactly 1 `type:` label, and they must have the label `status: ready for dev`.
Use `effort:` and `priority:` labels where helpful.

Split large issues into bit-sized pieces and list those in the larger issue‚Äôs description.

!!! example

```markdown
Requires several steps:

- [x] [write schema](#21)
- [x] [build schema linter](#22)
- [ ] [create infrastructure to deploy schema](#23)
```

### Handling pull requests

Do not submit a review until the required status checks completed successfully.
(You can add comments before this.)

When accepting pull requests, use either technique:

- Squash all commits into a single commit **(most cases)**.
  The commit subject should be the pull request title; edit the title if necessary.
- Rebase with all commits after ensuring that the messages conform to standards.

To help a contributor with their PR directly, see
["Committing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).
If the contributor abandoned the PR, instead use `gh pr checkout <number>`.

### Versioning, tags, & deployments

Versioning is a subset of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Pre-releases are permitted only in the forms `alpha<int>`, `beta<int>`, and `rc<int>`,
where `<int>` starts at `0`. Alpha/beta/RC MUST NOT be used out of order (e.g., **not** `alpha1`, `beta1`, `alpha2`).

Tags of the form `v<semver>` should result in full deployments.
Tags of the form `v<major>` should automatically track their most recent semver tags.
The `latest` tag should always match the main branch.

Deploy off of the main branch or tags.
Make sure tests passed on the main branch before deploying.

## Legal things

### Source headers

Ensure that nontrivial files contain a header:

```text
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright <years>, Contributors to <project>
SPDX-PackageHomePage: <url>
SPDX-License-Identifier: <spdx-id>
```

!!! example
For [Tyranno](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyrannosaurus), this is:

```text
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright 2020-2023, Contributors to CICD
SPDX-PackageHomePage: https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyranno
SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

### 3rd-party code

Use SPDX headers in the aforementioned form.
Include a section in `NOTICE.txt` mentioning the source file(s), license, and external source.
Include the license file in the form `LICENSE-<spdx-id>.txt`.

## Reference

## Commit messages and changelog

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) using the following types.
The general pattern for the subject is `<type>[(<scope>)][!]: <subject>`,
where `(<scope>)` is a empty, `plugins`, or `i18n` and `!` denotes a breaking change.
Examples:

- `feat!: add schema`
- `doc(i18n): add JP translation`
  This table also shows how commit messages map to issue labels and changelog sections.

| Type        | Label               | Changelog section  | semver | Description                         |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `security:` | `type: security`    | `üîí Security`      | minor  | Fix a security issue                |
| `feat:`     | `type: feature`     | `‚ú® Features`      | minor  | Add or change a feature             |
| `fix:`      | `type: fix`         | `üêõ Bug fixes`     | patch  | Fix a bug                           |
| `docs:`     | `type: docs`        | `üìù Documentation` | patch  | Add or modify docs or examples      |
| `build:`    | `type: build`       | `üîß Build system`  | minor  | Modify build, including Docker      |
| `perf:`     | `type: performance` | `‚ö°Ô∏è Performance`  | patch  | Increase speed / decrease resources |
| `test:`     | `type: test`        | `üö® Tests`         | N/A    | Add or modify tests                 |
| `refactor:` | `type: refactor`    | ignored            | N/A    | Refactor source code                |
| `style:`    | `type: style`       | ignored            | N/A    | Improve style of source code        |
| `chore:`    | `type: chore`       | ignored            | N/A    | Change non-source code              |
| `ci:`       | `type: ci`          | ignored            | N/A    | Modify CI/CD                        |

**Full pattern:**

```text
<type>[(<scope>)][!]: <subject>

<body>

[BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking>]
[Closes: #<issue>]
[*: <author>]+

Signed-off-by: <author>

```

!!! example

```text
feat!: add major new feature

We added a major new feature.
Here are details: ta-da.
