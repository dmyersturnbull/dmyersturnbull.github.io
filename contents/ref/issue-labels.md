[contributor guide](contributor-guide.md).

## Groups

Labels are organized into are 8 groups.

- `type` **(mandatory)**: The kind of changes (matches commit types)
- `breaking` **(mandatory)**: Whether breaking changes are needed (in issues) or made (in PRs)
- changelog overrides: `changelog: include` and `changelog: exclude`
- `priority`: The importance and urgency
- `state`: What type of work needs to be done (development work is just 1 type)
- `effort`: How much work it requires
- `scope`: The component (matches commit scopes)
- miscellaneous:
  `question` (for user questions in issues),
  `help needed` (to request help),
  and `bookmark` (for issues that contain important information)

???+ rationale

    Requirements met:

    - The types are simply a superset of the current
      [Angular commit types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
      and other commonly used sets, including
      [Angular’s earlier revisions](#angular-commit-type-revisions).
    - Commit messages can be used to generate useful, complete, and obvious changelog.
    - Labels have obvious names and are grouped.

    As a bonus, the symbols are compatible with [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).
