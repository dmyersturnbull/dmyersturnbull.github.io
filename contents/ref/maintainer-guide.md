# Maintainers' guide

!!! abstract "How to use these docs"
    These docs are meant to be linked to.
    Include a link in your project's readme or _CONTRIBUTING.md_.
    E.g.,
    ```markdown
    See https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/ref/maintainer-guide/
    but disregard the `security:` commit type.
    ```

    Or just link to individual sections; e.g.,
    ```markdown
    Source headers: Please refer to https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/ref/maintainer-guide/#source-headers
    ```

This guide contains a collection of best-practices.
They tend to be easy to learn, easy to use, and easy to automate.
They work with a range of CI/CD workflows and various automation tools.
More notably, they are sufficient to get a transparent 1-1-1-1-1 mapping between
issues, feature branches, pull requests, main branch commits, and changelog entries.

## Branches

Use [GitLab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/)
/ [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).
Name feature branches `<type>/<issue>-<description>`, such as `feat/14-add-schema`.
Each must be tied to exactly 1 issue and result in 1 merge to _main_.
If used, stable release branches must be named `releases/<vr>`; e.g., `releases/v1`.

## Issues

Issues to be worked on must have exactly 1 `type:` label, and they must have the label `status: ready for dev`.
Use `effort:` and `priority:` labels where helpful.

Split large issues into bit-sized pieces and list those in the larger issue‚Äôs description.

!!! example

    ```markdown
    Requires several steps:

    - [x] [write schema](#21)
    - [x] [build schema linter](#22)
    - [ ] [create infrastructure to deploy schema](#23)
    ```

## Handling pull requests

Do not submit a review until the required status checks completed successfully.
(You can add comments before this.)

When accepting pull requests, use either technique:

- Squash all commits into one **(most cases)**.
  The commit subject should be the pull request title; edit the title if necessary.
- Rebase all commits after ensuring that the messages conform to standards.

To help a contributor with their PR directly, see
["Committing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).
If the contributor abandoned the PR, instead use `gh pr checkout <number>`.

## Versioning

Versioning is a subset of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Pre-releases are permitted only in the forms `alpha<int>`, `beta<int>`, and `rc<int>`,
where `<int>` starts at 0. Alpha/beta/RC MUST NOT be used out of order (e.g., **not** `alpha1`, `beta1`, `alpha2`).

## Tags and deployment

Tags of the form `v<semver>` should result in full deployments.
Tags of the form `v<major>` should automatically track their most recent semver tags.
The `latest` tag should always match the main branch.

Deploy off of the main branch or tags.
Make sure tests passed on the main branch before deploying.

## Source headers

Ensure that nontrivial files contain a header:

```text
SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright <years>, Contributors to <project>
SPDX-PackageHomePage: <url>
SPDX-License-Identifier: <spdx-id>
```

!!! example

    For [Tyranno](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyrannosaurus), this is:

    ```text
    SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright 2020-2023, Contributors to CICD
    SPDX-PackageHomePage: https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyranno
    SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
    ```

## 3rd-party code

Use SPDX headers in the aforementioned form.
Include a section in `NOTICE.txt` mentioning the source file(s), license, and external source.
Include the license file in the form `LICENSE-<spdx-id>.txt`.

## Commit messages and changelog

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) using the following types.
The general pattern for the subject is `<type>[(<scope>)][!]: <subject>`,
where `(<scope>)` is empty, `plugins`, or `i18n`; and `!` denotes a breaking change.

!!! example
    ```text
    feat!: add schema
    ```
    ```text
    doc(i18n): add JP translation
    ```

This table shows how commit messages map to issue labels and changelog sections.
