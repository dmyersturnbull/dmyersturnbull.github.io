# Advanced BNF with regex

<b>Spec status: Use with caution.</b>
Although useful, applying it in practice might cause confusion.
Take it, modify it, use it. (CC-BY-SA)

Standards for specifying grammars are a mess, as [Wirth et al. describe](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/359863.359883).
David A. Wheeler also wrote a
[complaint about current grammar standards](https://dwheeler.com/essays/dont-use-iso-14977-ebnf.html),
particularly objecting to [ISO’s EBNF (ISO/IEC 14977:1996)](https://www.iso.org/standard/26153.html).
[ABNF (RFC5234)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234) is an improvement,
but it doesn’t use regex and has a non-obvious syntax for repetitions.
The [W3C XML EBNF](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-notation) is better,
but it still lacks some functionality and the expressiveness that regex can provide.

!!! tip

    A tool called the
    [Railroad Diagram Generator](https://www.bottlecaps.de/rr/ui)
    can generate excellent diagrams from W3C XML EBNF.
    It’s maintained as of early 2025.

In the spirit of [XKCD #927](https://xkcd.com/927/), here is a new proposal.
It’s a hybrid between ABNF, W3C XML EBNF, and syntax from parser generators, including [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/).
Use it to describe
[PEGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)
and
[CFGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar).

Compatible with either ABNF or W3C XML EBNF (but not both for one document), _regex-bnf_ supports full
[ECMA 262 regular expressions](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-patterns),
and has additional, very powerful features such as intersections (i.e. rule A **and** rule B).
Core rules are defined, such as `ALPHA`, `BASE64`, and `RFC-3339-DATETIME`.

## Grammar

The formal grammar for regex-bnf is presented in both itself and in
[W3C XML EBNF](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-notation).

```

## Style guide

- Use `=` instead of `::=`.
- Align the `=` at a generous column, with plenty of space to rename rules for clarity
  (or to add new rules, if the grammar is still being designed).
- Limit lines to 120 characters, breaking before `|` (preferably) or another operator as needed.
  On the continued line, put the operator on the same column as the `=`.
  The goal here is to limit the number of lines unnecessarily included in a diff.
- Align `;` comments to 2 characters after the `=`.
- Always use `-` to separate words in rule names.
