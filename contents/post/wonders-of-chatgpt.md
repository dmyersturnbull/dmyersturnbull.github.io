A collection of ChatGPT responses that were useful, great, strange, strange, or just unparsable nonsense.

## Mathematics of subtractive color spaces

## Apple math

Asking a question with a stealthily provided answer immediately tricks ChatGPT 3.5.
ChatGPT 4 saw through my scheme.

<b>ChatGPT 3.5:</b>

> > I have 6 apples today. I ate 4 apples yesterday. How many apples do I have today?

> If you had 6 apples today and you ate 4 apples yesterday, then you would have:
> 6 apples (today) - 4 apples (ate yesterday) = 2 apples
> So, you would have 2 apples today.

> > That's wrong.

> > Apologies for the mistake. Let me correct it.
> > If you had 6 apples today and you ate 4 apples yesterday, then you would have:
> > 6 apples (today) - 4 apples (ate yesterday) = 2 apples
> > So, you would have 2 apples today.

> > Am I an apple?

> No, you're not an apple.
> You're a person.
> I misunderstood your question.
> If you're referring to yourself, then the number of apples you have today would still be 1,
> assuming you haven't acquired or consumed any additional apples since yesterday.

<b>ChatGPT 4:</b>

> > I have 6 apples today. I ate 4 apples yesterday. How many apples do I have today?

> You still have 4 apples today. Eating the apples yesterday doesn't change the number of apples you have today.
