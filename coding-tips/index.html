You should fix it later.</li><li>Wrap dependencies on complex systems into <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern>facades</a>
so that your code interacts through that facade.</li><li>New tools really do tend to be better. Older systems often become ridiculously complex and hard
to configure. For example, <a href=https://caddyserver.com/>Caddy</a> is a fantastic swap‐in for httpd
for 99% of applications.</li><li>Strong typing is uniformly better than dynamic typing. The latter encourages
programming malpractice, inefficient code, and silent bugs.</li><li>Objects should be immutable unless mutability is clearly needed.</li><li>Nullity is the enemy. Don’t allow null values unless you’ve made that clear and the meaning
of a null value is clear.</li><li>Avoid inheritence like the plague. Traits and interfaces are ok.</li><li>Don’t use concurrency based on shared memory unless you’re writing firmware.</li><li>Functional programming is fantastic.</li><li>Don’t <a href=https://github.com/jezen/is-thirteen>over‐engineer</a>.</li><li>Don’t use libraries with low traction or too few GitHub stars.</li><li>Write comments to document tricky points, not because it’s a “good practice”. There can be entire
classes that don’t need more than a class header. If you write unnecessary comments, you’ll
likely end up with comments describing behavior that no longer exists, which can do real harm.</li><li>It’s sometimes ok to copy a few lines to avoid an unwanted dependency.</li><li>Think about the layers that your code has and don’t mix layers.</li><li>Use config files and/or environment variables for dependency injection.</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_testing>Property testing</a> is amazing. I’ve found bugs
that would otherwise be almost impossible to find.</li></ul></article></html>
